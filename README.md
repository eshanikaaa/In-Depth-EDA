# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using the built-in version from the Seaborn library. The analysis aims to understand the structure of the dataset, detect missing values and outliers, explore relationships between features, and uncover insights related to passenger survival.

# Dataset Information
Source: Built-in dataset from the seaborn Python library,
Rows: 891,
Columns: 15,
Target Variable: survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# Technologies Used:-
Python 3,
Google Colab,
Pandas,
Seaborn,
Matplotlib,
NumPy

# Key EDA Steps
1)Data Loading & Overview
2)Missing Values Analysis
3)Univariate Analysis
4)Outlier Detection
5)Bivariate Analysis
6)Correlation Matrix
7)Multivariate Analysis

# Key Findings
-Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
-1st-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.
-Children and younger passengers showed slightly better survival odds.
-Higher fare passengers generally had higher survival rates.
-The deck column has excessive missing values and may not be useful without imputation.
